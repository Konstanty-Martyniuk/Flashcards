# Flashcards
## About
When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new vocabulary, which is exactly where flashcards can help. Typically, flashcards show a hint (a task or a picture) on one side and the right answer on the other. Flashcards can be used to remember any sort of data, so if you want to create a useful tool to help your learning and your programming skills, this project is for you.
Learning outcomes
In this project, you will learn how to work with files and call them from the command line.

### What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
- Stage 1/7: Stage one, card one 
Display information about a single card on the screen
- Stage 2/7: What’s on the card? 
Compare the lines and work with conditions: display the card and the user’s answer on the screen
- Stage 3/7: Make it your own 
Practice arrays and loops: create a new card for the program to play with you.
- Stage 4/7: A good stack 
Learn to use hashtables, display key values and work with exceptions in order to fix the problem of repeating cards.
- Stage 5/7: Menu, please! 
Work with files: create a menu that allows to add, delete, save and upload saved cards in your game.
- Stage 6/7: Statistics 
Using statistics, set a correct answer for each card and teach the game to determine which card was the hardest to solve
- Stage 7/7: IMPORTant
